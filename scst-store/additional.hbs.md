Supply Chain Security Tools - Store is released as an individual Tanzu Application Platform component.

> **Note:** The Insight CLI requires a [separate installation](cli_installation.md).

For more information, see [Deployment Details and Configuration](deployment_details.md).

The following steps are required to use the API or CLI:
