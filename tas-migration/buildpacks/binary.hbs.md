# Migrate Binary buildpack

- The functionality provided by the TAS Binary buildpack is provided in TAP by the TAP Procfile buildpack.

- In CF/TAS, Procfile functionality is built into the platform (see documentation). However, due to the nature of the CF (TAS) api, a no-op/null buildpack was required, and this null buildpack was named Binary buildpack. See the genesis issue for the Binary buildpack.

- A Procfile follows the same format in TAS & TAP.

- If your app contains an executable (or an executable is generated by preceding buildpacks in the build process), you can simply use the TAP Procfile buildpack to run your app, just like you would do with the TAS Binary buildpack.

Hereâ€™s the `spec` section from a sample `workload.yaml`:

```yaml

spec:
  source:
    git:
      ref:
        branch: master
      url: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/binary-buildpack
    subPath: fixtures/default_app
```
