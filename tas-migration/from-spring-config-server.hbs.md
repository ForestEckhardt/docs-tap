# Migrate Spring Config Server applications from TAS to Tanzu Application Platform

Tanzu Application Service (TAS) and Tanzu Application Platform (TAP) both provide the ability to
load java properties into an application from a configuration repository, and it is possible to
migrate an application running on TAS with Spring Configuration Service (SCS) to Tanzu Application
Platform with Application Configuration Service (ACS).

Although this migration does not require changes to either the application code or the configuration
repository where properties are stored, the mechanism used to load properties into a Tanzu
Application Platform workload is quite different, and requires a substantially different setup.

At a high level SCS and ACS operate as follows:

- SCS instances run as web applications serving configuration via REST requests. TAS applications
  bound to SCS instances fetch configuration using an autowired `ConfigServerConfigDataLoader` bean
  and add it to the application properties.

- ACS `ConfigurationServer` instances are Kubernetes custom resources, reconciled by a controller
  manager. They are wired into Tanzu Application Platform Workloads using a `ConfigurationSlice`
  object. Each `ConfigurationSlice` creates a bindable Secret object containing properties that is
  mounted to the application file system and loaded into the Spring application from there.

The differences are illustrated below through the [cook](https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/cook)
sample application.

## Deploying the Cook application to TAS

At a high level, the steps to deploy on TAS are:

1. Create an SCS instance pointing to the
   [cook-config GitHub repository](https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/cook-config) by
   running:

   ```console
   cf create-service -c '{ "git": { "uri": "https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/cook-config", \
   "label": "main"  } }' ${service_name} standard cook-config-server
   ```

1. Run `cf push` to push the application to TAS with an application manifest that binds to the
   service instance:

    ```yaml
    ---
    applications:
      - name: cook
        host: cookie
        instances: 1
        memory: 1G
        services:
          - cook-config-server
        env:
          SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: development
          JBP_CONFIG_OPEN_JDK_JRE: '{ jre: { version: 17.+ }}'
    ```

More detailed instructions are in the
[README](https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/cook/blob/main/README.adoc) file.

## Migrate from TAS to Tanzu Application Platform

This section describes the areas to translate when creating a Tanzu Application Platform workload
that will deploy the same application.

### Create a config server instance

: TAS/SCS
Create a service instance by running `cf create-service`, specifying the URI and label (branch) of
the config repository in the configuration JSON.

   ```console
   cf create-service -c '{ "git": { "uri": "https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/cook-config", \
   "label": "main"  } }' p.config-server standard cook-config-server
   ```

: Tanzu Application Platform/ACS
Create a `ConfigurationSource` resource, specifying the location of the config repository in the
`spec.backends` property. For detailed options, see the
[ACS documentation](https://{{ vars.staging_toggle }}.vmware.com/en/Application-Configuration-Service-for-VMware-Tanzu/2.2/acs/GUID-gettingstarted-configuringworkloads.html#create-a-configuration-source).

### Specify the application name and Spring profiles

: TAS/SCS
To specify the application name and Spring profiles:

1. Specify the application name is specified in the `spring.application.name` property. In the case of the Cook
application, this is found in
[application.yml](https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/cook/blob/main/src/main/resources/application.yml).

1. Set the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable in the `env` key in the application manifest
   to designate profiles. Multiple entries must be comma-separated.

: Tanzu Application Platform/ACS
To specify the application name and Spring profiles:

1. Create a `ConfigurationSlice` resource, specifying the name of the `ConfigurationSource` resource
   in the `spec.configurationSource` property.

1. Create one or more entries in the `spec.content` array property of the `ConfigurationSlice`
   resource with the format `APP-NAME/PROFILE-NAME/OPTIONAL-LABEL` where:

   - `APP-NAME` is the application name.
   - `PROFILE-NAME` is the profile name.
   - `OPTIONAL-LABEL` is an optional comma-separated list of labels from which to retrieve properties.

   For more information, see the
   [ACS documentation](https://{{ vars.staging_toggle }}.vmware.com/en/Application-Configuration-Service-for-VMware-Tanzu/2.2/acs/GUID-crds-configurationslice.html#configurationslice-content).

### Bind the config server to the app

: TAS/SCS
To bind the config server to the app, add the service instance name in the services key in the
application manifest. Alternatively, run `cf bind-service` to bind the service to the application.

: Tanzu Application Platform/ACS
To bind the config server to the app:

1. Create a `ResourceClaim` resource, specifying the details of the `ConfigurationSlice` resource in
   the `spec.ref` section of the configuration.
1. Specify the `ResourceClaim` resource in the `spec.serviceClaims` section of the workload. This
   mounts the properties to the running podâ€™s filesystem.
1. Specify a `SPRING_CONFIG_IMPORT` property in the `spec.env` section of the workload with the
   value `optional:configtree:${SERVICE_BINDING_ROOT}/CLAIM-NAME/` where `CLAIM-NAME` is the name
   you specified in the `spec.serviceClaims` list.

   This environment variable tells the Spring runtime to pull properties in from the filesystem at
   the path where the `serviceClaims` mechanism mounted them. For more information, see
   [ACS documentation](https://{{ vars.staging_toggle }}.vmware.com/en/Application-Configuration-Service-for-VMware-Tanzu/2.2/acs/GUID-gettingstarted-configuringworkloads.html#using-configuration-in-a-workload).
