# Overview of Tanzu Developer Tools for IntelliJ

Tanzu Developer Tools for IntelliJ is the official VMware Tanzu IDE extension for IntelliJ IDEA.
The extension helps you develop with Tanzu Application Platform and enables you to rapidly iterate
on your workloads on supported Kubernetes clusters that have Tanzu Application Platform installed.

The extension currently only supports Java apps.

## <a id="extension-features"></a> Extension features

This extension gives the following features.

- **Deploy applications directly from IntelliJ:**

    Rapidly iterate on your applications on Tanzu Application Platform and deploy them as workloads
    directly from within IntelliJ.

- **See code updates running on-cluster in seconds:**

    With the use of Live Update facilitated by Tilt, deploy your workload once, save changes to the
    code and then, seconds later, see those changes reflected in the workload running on the cluster.

- **Debug workloads directly on the cluster:**

    Debug your application in a production-like environment by debugging on your
    Kubernetes cluster that has Tanzu Application Platform.
    An environmentâ€™s similarity to production relies on keeping dependencies updated, among other
    variables.
